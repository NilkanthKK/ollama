        }

        ### STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:

        1. ✅ **FLOAT NUMBERS: ALWAYS INCLUDE DECIMALS**
        - All monetary values must be returned as **floats with exactly two decimal places**.
        - If an amount is written as `15058000.00`, return it as `15058000.00`, not `15058000`.
        - Never drop `.00` or convert to integer.
        - Example:
            - `₹15058000.00` → `15058000.00`
            - `₹15000000` → `15000000.00`
            

        2. ✅ **ITEM EXTRACTION RULES**
        - Count every row in the item table. Extract exactly that many items.
        - Do NOT add extra rows.
        - `item_name`: Extract only the main product name. Remove codes, serial numbers, etc.
        - `hsn_code`: Extract HSN/SAC code exactly as shown.
        - `quantity`: Use number from "Qty" column.
        - `unit`: Unit like NOS, UNT, PCS, etc.
        - `rate`: Rate per unit as shown (e.g., `1500.00`).
        - `amount`: Use value from "Taxable Amount" or "Total" column. DO NOT calculate.

        3. ✅ **KEY FIELD RULES**
        - `party_name`: From "Bill From", "Buyer", or "Customer Name".
        - `party_address`: Full address including PIN code.
        - `party_gst_number`: GSTIN exactly as written. E.g., "27AABCCDDEEFFG if GSTIN else None".
        - `place_of_supply`: State name mentioned under "Place of Supply".
        - `invoice_amount`: Total amount labeled as "Total Amount", "Bill Amount", or "Grand Total". Must include `.00` if present.
        - `taxable_amount`: Sum of "Taxable Amt" column.
        - `tax_amount`: Tax amount (e.g., `58000.00`).

        4. ✅ **CHARACTER CLARITY**
        - If 'S' looks like '5', 'O' like '0', 'I' like '1', etc., return:
            ```json
            { "error": "Ambiguous character detected. Please upload a clearer image." }
            ```
        - Do not guess.

        5. ✅ **QUALITY CHECK**
        - If image is BLURRY, CROPPED, or LOW QUALITY and any field cannot be read with 100% confidence, return:
            ```json
            { "error": "Unclear image. Please upload a clear, complete, and legible invoice." }
            ```

        6. ✅ **OUTPUT FORMAT**
        - Return ONLY the JSON object.
        - No explanation, no markdown, no text before or after.
        - Wrap JSON in ```json if needed, but ensure it's parseable.

        RETURN ONLY THE JSON. NO OTHER TEXT.'''
